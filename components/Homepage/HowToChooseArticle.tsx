                Step 1: Define Your Needs
              </h3>
              <p>
                Before you start the hunt, the first step is to fully define
                your needs. Here are three key areas to consider:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <strong>Design needs:</strong> Are you looking to build a new
                  website from the ground up? Or do you have a current digital
                  presence that needs either a light refresh or a complete
                  overhaul?
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Design approach:</strong> Are you satisfied to settle
                  with an agency that works with templates or do you need an
                  agency that designs custom websites?
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Website goals:</strong> What are your specific goals
                  for the website? For example: Higher search engine ranking,
                  more traffic, greater engagement, increased conversion.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Website requirements:</strong> What are your specific
                  requirements for the website? Do you have a platform in mind?
                  Create a list of must-have features and functionalities, along
                  with a list of nice-to-have’s if your budget allows.
                </li>
              </ul>

                submitting a proposal or a bid.

                The best way to find an agency for your digital project is of

              <p>
                Whether you use a marketplace or Google to find potential
                partners, the next step is thorough research. For each agency
                you’re interested in, explore the agency’s:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <strong>Website:</strong> For an agency that you’re
                  considering partnering with, a professional website design is
                  a must.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Services:</strong> Some agencies focus on specific
                  areas like web design or branding, while full-service agencies
                  offer an entire scope of digital services.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Portfolio:</strong> Any reputable agency will have a{" "}

                    digital portfolio
                  </a>{" "}
                  easily accessible and available for potential clients to view.
                  Look through the projects to get an idea of the agency’s
                  capabilities in terms of design, development, branding and
                  other applicable areas, in different industries.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Client testimonials:</strong> Get a feel for what it’s
                  like to work with the agency through client testimonials that
                  provide feedback about processes, team members and
                  deliverables.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                Shortlist agencies based on these factors and create a list of
                3-5 agencies to set up a meeting with — which brings us to the

              <p>
                Meeting with your potential partner, whether in person or
                digitally, allows you to get to know the team members who will
                be working on your project and ask questions about what the
                agency’s processes look like behind-the-scenes.

              <p>
                Some questions to ask when hiring a professional web design
                agency include:
              </p>
              <ol>

                  What digital services do you offer in addition to web design?

                <li>
                  Do you have experience working with clients in my industry?

                <li>What does your website design process look like?</li>
                <li>What does your website development process look like?</li>
                <li>
                  Who are the team members that will be working on my project?
                </li>
                <li>
                  Will you provide recommendations and ideas for my project?
                </li>
                <li>
                  What will our partnership look like in terms of communication
                  and project updates?
                </li>
                <li>
                  How much will my project cost and how long will it take to
                  complete?
                </li>
                <li>How do you measure results?</li>
              </ol>

                with the agency will look like throughout the life of your
                partnership — all important factors to consider when choosing
                the best web design agency for your project.

                Finally, it’s time to choose the best agency for the job. Base

                and the information you gathered.
              </p>
              <p>
                From the agency’s portfolio of past projects to the way they
                handle partnerships and measure success, the right agency will
                be one that offers a term of experts, project ownership and
                complete transparency throughout your project.
